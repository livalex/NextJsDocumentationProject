// Parallel Routes allows you to simultaneously or conditionally render one or
// more pages within the same layout. They are useful for highly dynamic
// sections of an app, such as dashboards and feeds on social sites.

// Parallel routes are created using named slots. Slots are defined with the
// @folder convention.

const page = () => {
  return <div>Team Slot</div>;
